It's a simulation, where "critters", live, die, compete and evolve.
The primary goal was not to mimic complex behaviours but write simple natural laws and "genetic system", you are an observer watching evolution take place in the world you created!

Each critter has a "DNA" to it, when it undergoes "reproduction" there's a 15% chance said "DNA" is mutated!
